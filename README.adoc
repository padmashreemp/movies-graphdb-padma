This example application demonstrates how easy it is to get started with https://neo4j.com/developer[Neo4j] in Java.

It is a very simple web application that uses our Movie graph dataset to provide a search with listing, a detail view and a graph visualization.

=== Setup

Make sure to install a https://jdk.java.net/[JDK 11+] and https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[Apache Maven].

=== Run locally

Just run:

[source,shell]
----
mvn compile exec:java
----

Go to http://localhost:8080.

You can search for movies by title or and click on any entry.

Or better you can run Neo4j locally to experiment with your own data.
Start your local Neo4j Server in Neo4j Desktop (https://neo4j.com/download[Download & Install]), open Neo4j Browser.
After logging in, install the Movies graph data set by entering the `:play movies` command, click the CREATE-statement, and hit the triangular "Run" button.
